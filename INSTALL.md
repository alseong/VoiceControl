## What You Get

‚úÖ **Complete Voice Control** - Actually controls GarageBand with keyboard shortcuts

## System Requirements

- **macOS** (required for GarageBand)
- **Python 3.6+**
- **Microphone** (built-in or external)
- **GarageBand** installed and running

## Permissions Needed

When you first run the app, macOS will ask for:

1. **Microphone Access** - For voice recognition
2. **Accessibility Access** - For sending keyboard shortcuts to GarageBand

Both are required for the app to work.

## Usage

1. **Open GarageBand** first
2. **Run the Python script** - Browser opens automatically
3. **Click the microphone button** in the web interface
4. **Start talking!** - Say commands like "play", "stop", "new track"

## Voice Commands

Try saying any of these:

**Playback:** "play", "stop", "record", "beginning"  
**Tracks:** "new track", "delete track", "mute track", "solo track"  
**Editing:** "undo", "redo", "cut", "copy", "paste", "split"  
**Tools:** "zoom in", "zoom out", "toggle loop", "toggle metronome"  
**Project:** "save", "new project"  

## Troubleshooting

**"No module named 'pyaudio'"**
```bash
# Install PortAudio first
brew install portaudio
pip install pyaudio
```

**"Permission denied" errors**
- Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Accessibility
- Add Terminal or your Python app to the allowed apps

**Voice not recognized**
- Check microphone permissions
- Speak clearly and wait for the interface to show "Listening..."
- Try different phrasings ("play" vs "start playback")

## Demo vs Full Version

üåê **[Try the Demo](https://voice-control-blush.vercel.app)** - Voice recognition only, runs in browser  
‚¨áÔ∏è **Download Full Version** - Actually controls GarageBand, runs locally  

The demo shows voice recognition working perfectly, but only the downloaded version can actually control GarageBand due to browser security limitations.
