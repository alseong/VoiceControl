## First Time Setup

When you first run the app, macOS will ask for permissions:

1. **"Allow microphone access?"** ‚Üí Click **Allow**
2. **"Allow accessibility access?"** ‚Üí Click **Allow** (or go to System Preferences)

Both permissions are required for voice control to work.

## Usage

1. **Open GarageBand** first
2. **Double-click the app** - Browser opens automatically  
3. **Click the microphone button** in the web interface
4. **Start talking!** - Say "play", "stop", "new track", etc.

## Voice Commands

**Playback:** "play", "stop", "record", "beginning"  
**Tracks:** "new track", "delete track", "mute track", "solo track"  
**Editing:** "undo", "redo", "cut", "copy", "paste", "split"  
**Tools:** "zoom in", "zoom out", "toggle loop", "toggle metronome"  
**Project:** "save", "new project"  

## Troubleshooting

**"App can't be opened because it's from an unidentified developer"**
1. Right-click the app ‚Üí **Open**
2. Click **Open** in the dialog
3. macOS will remember this choice

**"App wants to access microphone"**
- Click **Allow** - required for voice recognition

**"App wants accessibility access"**
- Click **Allow** or go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Accessibility
- Add the app to allowed apps

**Voice commands not working**
- Make sure GarageBand is open and focused
- Check that microphone permission is granted
- Speak clearly when the interface shows "Listening..."

## Demo vs Full Version

üåê **[Try the Demo](https://voice-control-blush.vercel.app)** - Voice recognition only  
üöÄ **Download Full App** - Actually controls GarageBand

## System Requirements

- **macOS 10.13+** (High Sierra or later)
- **GarageBand** installed
- **Microphone** (built-in or external)
- **Internet connection** (for initial voice recognition setup)
